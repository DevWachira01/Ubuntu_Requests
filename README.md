# Ubuntu Image Fetcher 🐧

A Python tool for **mindfully collecting images** from the web, built with Ubuntu principles:  

- **Community** → Connects with the wider web  
- **Respect** → Handles errors gracefully  
- **Sharing** → Stores images neatly in a shared folder  
- **Practicality** → Simple, useful, and ready to use
